The name should appear at the top in bold, slightly larger than other text.

Contact details should be directly below the name, in a smaller, readable font.

Section headers should be bold and clearly separated.

Work experience should be listed in reverse chronological order, with company names, job titles, and dates of employment.
Bullet points should be used to summarize responsibilities and achievements.

Skills should be formatted as a list of key competencies relevant to the desired job.

Additional information (e.g., certifications, languages, volunteer work) should be included at the end in a well-structured manner.

Ensure the text is structured for easy conversion into a well-formatted PDF or DOCX document. The final result should look polished and professional.

If any category is empty or contains an unclear expression (for example - -- no non null asdfgd 1111 ),
do not fill in this category when writing your resume. Leave such a category empty.
